Binary Two-Stage Designs
========================

A `Julia <http://julialang.org>`_ package implementing methods for planning and
evaluation of exact single-arm two-stage designs with binary endpoint.

              designs with binary endpoint

`BinaryTwoStageDesigns <https://github.com/imbi-heidelberg/BinaryTwoStageDesigns>`_
provides functionality for working with exact single-arm two-stage designs for
clinical trials with binary endpoint.
Special focus lies on the computation of optimal two-stage designs extending
the ideas of [Simon1989]_ using the `Julia <http://julialang.org/>`_
programming language.
BinaryTwoStageDesigns relies heavily on the functionality of the
`JuMP <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl>`_ package and is tested against the
commercial mixed integer programming solver
`Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com/index>`_.
While JuMP supports other solvers the use of Gurobi is highly recommended.
Academic licenses for Gurobi can be obtained free of charge upon request.

Installation
------------

For those not familiar with Julia, `<http://julialang.org/learning/>`_ might be
a good starting point.
The language can be tried out without having to install any software via the
Julia containers provided by `<https://www.juliabox.org/>`_ for free
(Google account required for sign in).

Make sure Gurobi/`Gurobi.jl <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Gurobi.jl>`/JuMP are
working correctly before using any of the functionality involving optimization.

The package is not yet registered and the current development verions can be
installed via

    Julia> Pgk.clone("https://github.com/imbi-heidelberg/BinaryTwoStageDesigns")

A specific release can then be installed by checking-out the respective
branch, e.g.

    Julia> Pkg.checkout("BinaryTwoStageDesigns", "0.1")

The documentation of the current development version is available under
`<https://imbi-heidelberg.github.io/BinaryTwoStageDesigns>` and previous versions
can be found under /docs/build/html/index.html of the respective release.

Quick-start
